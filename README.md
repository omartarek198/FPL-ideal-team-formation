# FPL-ideal-team-formation
## Used the offical premier league api to retrive all players data.
### Evaluated the players based on :
#### Total points scored by the player
#### Total minutes played by the player
#### The percantage of other users who selected the player
#### The cost of the player 
### Using the previous data, and using the BackTrack algorithm, the following squad was generated.

#### Really excited to see how well this squad preformes in comparison to other squads created by other users.

## Important note : the api for FPL resets it's player data every new season and this squad was selected based on the data from season 2021/2022, as a result, same code might generate different squad later
